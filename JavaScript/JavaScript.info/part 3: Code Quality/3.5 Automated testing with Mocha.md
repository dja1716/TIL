### Automated testing means that tests are written separately, in addition to the code. They run our functions in various ways and compare results with the expected.

## Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
* BDD is three things in one: tests AND documentation AND examples
example.
```javascript
describe("pow", function() {

  it("raises to n-th power", function() {
    assert.equal(pow(2, 3), 8);
  });

});
```
```javascript
describe("title", function() { ... })
```
* describe functionalities and group "workers" - the it blocks.
```javascript
it("use case description", function() { ... })
```
* title of it descrive particular use case, the second argument is a function that tests it

```javascript
assert.equal(value1, value2)
```
