### Automated testing means that tests are written separately, in addition to the code. They run our functions in various ways and compare results with the expected.

## Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
* BDD is three things in one: tests AND documentation AND examples
example.
```javascript
describe("pow", function() {

  it("raises to n-th power", function() {
    assert.equal(pow(2, 3), 8);
  });

});
```
```javascript
describe("title", function() { ... })
```
* describe functionalities and group "workers" - the it blocks.
```javascript
it("use case description", function() { ... })
```
* title of it descrive particular use case, the second argument is a function that tests it

```javascript
assert.equal(value1, value2)
```

# The development flow
1. an initial spec is written, with tests for the most basic functionality.
2. An initial implementation is created.
3. To check whether it works, we run the testing framework that runs the spec. While the functionality is not complete, errors are displayed. We make corrections until everything works.
4. Now we have a working initial implementation with tests.
5. We add more use cases to the spec, probably not yet supported by the implementations. Tests start to fail.
6. Go to 3, update implementation till tests give no errors.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 till the functionality is ready.

## before/after and beforeEach/afterEach
* We can setup before/after functions that execute before/after running tests, and also beforeEach/afterEach functions that execude before/after every it
