# "new" operator
* enable us to create many similar objects
* whereas the regular {...} syntax allows us to create one object

# Constructor function
* thechinically constructor functions are regular functions
* There are two conventions though:
  1. They are named with capital letter first
  2. They should be executed only with "new" operator
* what "new" does
  1. a new empty object is created and assigned to "this"
  2. The function executes
  3. The value of "this" is returned
* below two scripts does the same
```javascript
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.isAdmin = false;
}

let user = new User("Jack");

alert(user.name); // Jack
alert(user.isAdmin); // false
```
```javascript
function User(name) {
  // this = {};  (implicitly)

  // add properties to this
  this.name = name;
  this.isAdmin = false;

  // return this;  (implicitly)
}
```
## Encapsulation with new function() {...}
```javascrript
// create a function and immediately call it with new
let user = new function() {
  this.name = "John";
  this.isAdmin = false;

  // ...other code for user creation
  // maybe complex logic and statements
  // local variables etc
};
```
