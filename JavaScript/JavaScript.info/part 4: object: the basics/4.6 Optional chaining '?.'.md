## Don't overuse the optional chaining
- If we overuse '?.', coding errors can be silenced where not appropriate, and become more difficlut to debug

### The variable before '?.' must be declared
```javascript
// ReferenceError: user is not defined
user?.address;
```

# Short-circuiting
- '?.' immediately stops ("short-circuits") the evaluation if the left part doesn't exist
- So, if there are any further function calls or operations to the right of '?.'
- example
```javascript
let user = null;
let x = 0;

user?.sayHi(x++); // no "user", so the execution doesn't reach sayHi call and x++

alert(x); // 0, value not incremented
```
