## delete property
```javascript
delete user.age;
```

## multiword propoerty
```javascript
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  "likes birds": true  // multiword property name must be quoted
};

// this would give a syntax error
user.likes birds = true
```
```javascript
let user = {};

// set
user["likes birds"] = true;

// get
alert(user["likes birds"]); // true

// delete
delete user["likes birds"];
```


## Good Example of Javascript Object
```javascript
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

let key = prompt("What do you want to know about the user?", "name");

// access by variable
alert( user[key] ); // John (if enter "name")
```

## Computed Properties
```javascript
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");

let bag = {
  [fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
};

alert( bag.apple ); // 5 if fruit="apple"
```
