## strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion
* In other words, if a and b are of different types, then a === b immediately returns false without an attempt to convert them.


## Strange result: null vs 0
```javascript
alert( null > 0 );  // (1) false
alert( null == 0 ); // (2) false
alert( null >= 0 ); // (3) true

alert( undefined > 0 ); // false (1)
alert( undefined < 0 ); // false (2)
alert( undefined == 0 ); // false (3)
```
* undefined converted to NaN


## Avoid problems
* Treat any comparison with undefined/null except the strict equality === with exceptional care
* Don't use comparisons >= > < <= with a variable which may be null/undefined, unless you're really sure of what you're doing. If a variable can have there values, check for them separately.
