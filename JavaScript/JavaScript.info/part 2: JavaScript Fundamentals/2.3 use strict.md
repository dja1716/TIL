# use strict
## effects
1. Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
2. Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.
3. Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.

## syntax
* located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.
* for Module and Class, strict mode is already applied
