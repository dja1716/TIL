# Data types

## Number
* Infinity, -Infinity
* NaN
  * NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, for instance:
 ```javascript
 alert( NaN + 1 ); // NaN
alert( 3 * NaN ); // NaN
alert( "not a number" / 2 - 1 ); // NaN
 ```
* integer range
 * -(2^53 - 1) ~ (2^53 - 1)

## BigInt
* BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.
* A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:
```javascript
// the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```
