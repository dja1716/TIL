## alert
```javascript
alert("Hello");
```
* can't interact with the rest of the page, press other buttons, until they have dealt with the window.


## prompt
```javascript
result = prompt(title, [default]);
```
* shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/Cancel
### title
* the text to show the visitor
### default
* An optional second parameter, the initial value for the input field

* when visitor hit OK, the text in the input field is returned.
* otherwise (ex, hitting Cancel, or ESC key) null is returned

```javascript
let age = prompt('How old are you?', 100);

alert(`You are ${age} years old!`); // You are 100 years old!
```
## confirm
```javascript
result = confirm(question);
let isBoss = confirm("Are you the boss?");

alert( isBoss ); // true if OK is pressed
```
* shows a modal with a question and two buttons: OK and Cancel;
* the result is true if Ok is pressed and false otherwise

## All these methods are modal: they pause script execution and don’t allow the visitor to interact with the rest of the page until the window has been dismissed

## Limitation
The exact location of the modal window is determined by the browser. Usually, it’s in the center. <br />
The exact look of the window also depends on the browser. We can’t modify it.
