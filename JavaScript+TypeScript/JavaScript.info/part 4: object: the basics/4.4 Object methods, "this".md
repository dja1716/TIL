## interesting javascript usage
```javascript
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

user.sayHi = function() {
  alert("Hello!");
};

user.sayHi(); // Hello!
```

## OOP method definition
```javascript
// these objects do the same

user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
  sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
    alert("Hello");
  }
};
```

# "this" in methods
* To access the object, a method can use the this keyword
## #1 example - recommended
```javascript
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
    // "this" is the "current object"
    alert(this.name);
  }

};

user.sayHi(); // John
```
* #2 another way (unreliable)
```javascript
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
    alert(user.name); // "user" instead of "this"
  }

};
```
* #2's bad case
```javascript
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
    alert( user.name ); // leads to an error
  }

};


let admin = user;
user = null; // overwrite to make things obvious

admin.sayHi(); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null
```

# "this" is not bounded
* any function can have "this" even if it's not a mothod of an object
## example
```javascript
let user = { name: "John" };
let admin = { name: "Admin" };

function sayHi() {
  alert( this.name );
}

// use the same function in two objects
user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;

// these calls have different this
// "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
user.f(); // John  (this == user)
admin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)

admin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method â€“ doesn't matter)
```
* good: functions can be reused for different objects
* bad: higher chance of mistakes

# Arrow functions have no "this"
* Arrow functions don't have their "own" this
* If we reference this from such a function, it's taken from the outer "normal" function
* For example, here arrow() users this from the outer user.sayHi()
```javascript
let user = {
  firstName: "Ilya",
  sayHi() {
    let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
    arrow();
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // Ilya
```
